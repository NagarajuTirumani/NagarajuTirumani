# Service-oriented Architecture
Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is an approach to developing software systems that are based on distributed resources.
Many companies like eBay, Amazon, IBM, and Hp are benefiting from their SOA efforts.
It is a way to make the software components reusable. It is an architectural approach for making use of services on the internet.
The services are exposed using standard network protocols – such as **SOAP** (Simple Object Access Protocol) / **HTTP** or **JSON/HTTP** – to send requests to read or change data.
* SOA allows users to combine a large number of facilities from services to form applications.

**There are three major roles in SOA**
### Service Provider:
The service provider is the maintainer of the service and they are responsible to provide services to customers through the registry. The registry is nothing but a service contract, it contains the nature of the service, how can you use it, requirements, the Amount u have to pay, etc.
### Service Registry or Service Broker:
Its main functionality is to make the information regarding the web service available to any potential requester. Whoever implements the broker decides the scope of the broker. Public brokers are available anywhere and everywhere but private brokers are only available to a limited amount of the public.
### Service Customer:
Service customer locates the services in the registry and develops the software with it. The service customer sends the request to the service provider, processes the request, and gives a response to the customer.

## Microservices:
Microservices are a modern interpretation of service-oriented architectures used to build distributed software systems. Services in a microservice architecture are processes that communicate with each other over the network in order to fulfill a goal. These services use technology agnostic protocols, which aid in encapsulating the choice of language and frameworks, making their choice a concern internal to the service. Microservices are a new realization and implementation approach to SOA, which have become popular since 2014 (and after the introduction of Devops), and which also emphasize continuous deployment and other agile practices

## Advantages of SOA:

### 1)Reusability: 
   * applications can be made from existing services. Thus, services can reuse to make different applications.
### 2)Easy to use:
   * services are independent of any technology and tool. They can be updated easily, and modified easily without affecting the services.
### 3)Availability:
   * These services are available to anyone on request.
### 4)Reliability:
   * Due to the reliability advantage, we can identify bugs and easy to debug small services.
### 5)Scalability:
   * services can run in multiple environments due to their scalability.
 
## The disadvantage of SOA:

### 1)High Investment:
   * It requires a large amount of capital to start services.
### 2)Complexity in service management:
   * when services are interacting with each other, there are so many messages that are exchanged between them. These messages are in millions. So, Handling the complexity is a very tough task.

## Advantages in Realtime:

* These are used in the army and airforce to deploy the situations awareness system.
* It is also useful in delivering the healthcare system.
* Many apps nowadays are running using these inbuilt functions.
